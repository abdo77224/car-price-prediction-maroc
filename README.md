# Introduction
## Objectives
The goal of this project is to predict car prices in the Moroccan market using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
The project includes several stages: data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and deployment of the user interface using Streamlit.

# Data Collection and Preparation
## Data Collection
The data was collected from various online sources such as Avito.ma, Moteur.ma, and Wandaloo Maroc.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed in the **`data_cleaned.ipynb`** file.





# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Correlations between Variables
# Modeling and Training
# Validation and Optimization
# Deployment and User Interface with Streamlit
Streamlit App
The user interface was created in app.py using Streamlit. This interface allows users to input vehicle features and get a price estimate.

Here is a link to the app.py file on GitHub:
Streamlit App - app.py

To run the Streamlit app locally, use the following command:

bash
Copier
Modifier
# Run the Streamlit app locally
streamlit run app.py

# Conclusion
The car price prediction model for the Moroccan market yielded good results, with optimal performance on the test set. The model can be improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters and using more data.
